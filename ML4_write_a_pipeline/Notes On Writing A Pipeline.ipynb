    "* m: gives the slope\n",
    "* b: gives the y-int\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these parameters you can plot the values for x. In regards to supervised learning, my classify function might have some parameters as well. But, the input _X_ are the _features_ I want to classify, and the output _y_ is a _label_ (i.e. spam or not spam, or the type of flower). \n",
    "\n",
    "# <span style = \"color:red\"> IMAGE <span>\n",
    "\n",
    "What can the body of a function look like? This is the part you want to write algorithmically (i.e. learn). The important thing to understand here is that you are not starting from scratch and pullig the body of the funciton out of thin air. Instead, you start with a model. Think of a model as the _prototype_ or fhe _rules_ that define the body of your function. Typically a model has perameters that you can adjust with your training data.\n",

    "Let's say you're trying to destinguish between red dots and green dots. To do this I'll use the x & y coordinates of a dot. How can you classify this data? You want a function to consider a new dot it's never seen before and  classifies it as red or green; or maybe you have a lot of data you want to classifery (i.e. a lot of dots the classifier has never seen before). These are dots that weren't in our training data. Since the classifier has never seen them before, how can you predict the right label? Imagine if you could draw a line across the data. Then you could say the dots to the left of the line are green and the dots to the right of the line are red; and this line can serve as your classifier.\n",

    "So how can you learn this line? One way is to use this training data to adjust the parameters of this model, and the model you use is a simple straight line (like the one shown above). That means you have two parameters to adjust; _m_ and _b_, and by changing them you can change where the line appears. So, how can you learn the right parameters? One idea is that you can iteratively adjust them using the training data. For example, you might start with a random line, then use it to classify your first example. If the classifier gets the right, you don't need to change the line, and move on to the next example. But if it gets it wrong, you can slightly adjust the parameters of the model to make it more accurate. The takeaway here is, one way to think of learning is is using training data to adjust the parameters of a model. "
